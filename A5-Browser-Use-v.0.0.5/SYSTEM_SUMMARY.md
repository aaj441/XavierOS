🔗 Chain: ORM init → null connection string → panic
💉 Remedy: Add DATABASE_URL + restart
```

### Hypothesis Generation

- **Hidden dependency analysis**
- **System behavior pattern matching**
- **Confidence adjustment** based on alternatives
- **False positive elimination**

### Example Challenges
- "Environment variables set but not loaded by application"
- "Port binding delayed due to slow startup"
- "Application binding to wrong interface"

## 📊 Output Formats Delivered

### Human-Readable Summary
```
🧠 DEPLOYMENT FORENSICS & AUTOPSY PROTOCOL - FINAL REPORT
================================================================================

📊 HEALTH SCORE: 75/100

🧩 ROOT CAUSE MAP:
──────────────────────────────────────────────────
[1] Symptom → Missing required environment variables: ['OPENAI_API_KEY']
[1] Likely Cause → environment_configuration
[1] Trigger Chain → railway_deployment → env_vars → missing_vars
[1] Fix → Set environment variables: OPENAI_API_KEY
[1] Confidence → 95.0%
──────────────────────────────────────────────────
```
