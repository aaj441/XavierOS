# üö® XavierOS/Lucy Deployment Troubleshooting Guide

## üîç **Critical Issues Fixed**

### **Issue 1: Environment Variable Validation at Build Time**
**Problem:** Zod validation was failing during build because environment variables weren't available
**Solution:** ‚úÖ **FIXED**
- Made environment variables optional during build
- Added runtime validation for required fields
- Safe environment access in app.config.ts

### **Issue 2: Build Configuration Issues**
**Problem:** Build process was failing due to environment access issues
**Solution:** ‚úÖ **FIXED**
- Updated build script to set NODE_ENV=production
- Fixed allowedHosts configuration
- Added graceful error handling

### **Issue 3: Railway Compatibility**
**Problem:** Railway build environment differences
**Solution:** ‚úÖ **FIXED**
- Updated nixpacks.toml configuration
- Fixed Dockerfile for Railway
- Added start.sh backup script

## üöÄ **Deployment Steps**

### **Step 1: Set Environment Variables in Railway**

Go to Railway Dashboard ‚Üí Your Project ‚Üí Variables tab:

```bash
# Required Variables
NODE_ENV=production
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_secure_password_here
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_minimum_32_characters_long
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-v1-your-api-key-here

# Optional Variables (can be added later)
BASE_URL=https://your-railway-url.railway.app
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-app-password
EMAIL_FROM=noreply@lucy-accessibility.com
EMAIL_ENABLED=false
```

### **Step 2: Add PostgreSQL Database**

1. In Railway dashboard, click "New" ‚Üí "Database" ‚Üí "Add PostgreSQL"
2. Railway automatically sets `DATABASE_URL`
3. No additional configuration needed

### **Step 3: Verify Project Settings**

- **Root Directory:** `/` or empty
- **Branch:** `main`
- **Repository:** `https://github.com/aaj441/Lucy.git`

## üîß **Common Error Solutions**

### **Error: "ZodError: Required field missing"**
**Cause:** Missing environment variables
**Solution:** Add all required environment variables in Railway dashboard

### **Error: "P1001: Can't reach database server"**
**Cause:** No PostgreSQL database connected
**Solution:** Add PostgreSQL database in Railway dashboard

### **Error: "Build failed" or "Command not found"**
**Cause:** Build configuration issues
**Solution:** ‚úÖ **Already fixed** - Railway will use our updated configuration

### **Error: "EADDRINUSE" or port binding issues**
**Cause:** Port configuration problems
**Solution:** ‚úÖ **Already fixed** - XavierOS uses `process.env.PORT` (Railway compatible)

## üìã **Deployment Verification Checklist**

### **Before Deployment:**
- [ ] Environment variables set in Railway
- [ ] PostgreSQL database added
- [ ] Project settings verified
- [ ] Latest code pushed to GitHub

### **During Deployment:**
- [ ] Build logs show successful `pnpm install`
- [ ] Build logs show successful `pnpm prisma generate`
- [ ] Build logs show successful `pnpm build`
- [ ] Deploy logs show successful application start

### **After Deployment:**
- [ ] Application accessible at Railway URL
- [ ] Login/register functionality works
- [ ] Database operations work
- [ ] No console errors

## üö® **If Deployment Still Fails**

### **Step 1: Check Railway Logs**
1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. Click on your project
3. Click "Deployments" tab
4. Click on the failed deployment
5. Read both "Build Logs" and "Deploy Logs"

### **Step 2: Common Error Patterns**

**If you see:**
- `ZodError` ‚Üí Missing environment variables
- `P1001` ‚Üí Database not connected
- `EADDRINUSE` ‚Üí Port binding issue (should be fixed)
- `pnpm: command not found` ‚Üí Build configuration issue (should be fixed)
- `python3: command not found` ‚Üí Already fixed

### **Step 3: Force Redeploy**
- In Railway dashboard, click "Deploy" ‚Üí "Redeploy"
- This will trigger a fresh build with current configuration

### **Step 4: Check Environment Variables**
- Verify all required environment variables are set
- Check for typos in variable names
- Ensure values don't have extra spaces

## ‚úÖ **Expected Successful Deployment**

### **Build Logs Should Show:**
```
‚úì Installing dependencies with pnpm
‚úì Generating Prisma client
‚úì Building application with NODE_ENV=production
‚úì Build completed successfully
```

### **Deploy Logs Should Show:**
```
‚úì Starting XavierOS...
‚úì Database connected successfully
‚úì Server listening on port 3000
‚úì Application ready
```

### **Application Should:**
- Load at your Railway URL
- Show login/register page
- Allow user registration
- Connect to database successfully

## üéØ **Lucy Integration Status**

**Lucy is fully integrated into XavierOS:**
- ‚úÖ All Lucy features available in XavierOS
- ‚úÖ Single deployment for both systems
- ‚úÖ Shared database and authentication
- ‚úÖ Unified user interface

**No separate Lucy deployment needed** - everything is included in XavierOS.

---

## üìû **Still Having Issues?**

If deployment still fails after following this guide:

1. **Copy the exact error message** from Railway logs
2. **Check which step failed** (Build, Deploy, or Runtime)
3. **Verify environment variables** are set correctly
4. **Ensure PostgreSQL database** is connected

The fixes applied should resolve the most common deployment issues. The application is now Railway-ready with proper environment handling and build configuration.

**Status:** ‚úÖ **DEPLOYMENT ISSUES FIXED** - Ready for Railway deployment
**Next Step:** Set environment variables and PostgreSQL database in Railway dashboard
